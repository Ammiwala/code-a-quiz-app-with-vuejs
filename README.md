Single-page web apps are more and more in demand, but they can be hard to build with vanilla JavaScript. Thankfully, there are some powerful frameworks that can make the task easier: React, Angular, and Ember are some of the best-known. Vue.js is a newer option, that is very easy to learn and performant.

In this course, Derek Jensen will show you how easy it is to code an app with the Vue.js framework. You'll learn how to create a simple front-end web app using the Vue.js command line interface (CLI), create self-contained components, dynamically update the user interface, and even create a simple yet elegant user experience with Semantic UI. Follow along and you'll see how, with just a few simple skills, you too can begin building web apps with Vue.js.
